    <h1 style="color:blue;">Why did GoPro discontinued so of there proudicts </h1>
    <p style="color:black;">  The CEO GoPro was making some amazing products, but Nick Woodman started to spend a lot of money for him self. so after the compay was not not selling well afer 2015. in 
    2016 they were goin to lunch somthing so grate that the Nick Woodmand thought that GoPro was going to make more moeny like in 2014. but he thought wrong, the lunch day of his amazing inventons was the GoPro Karma. It was live in clifornia on oct. 15 2016, he also 
    introdueed the gopro hero 5 and the the the hero session 5. everyone was exited of all the things that Nick Woodman introuduced. The GoPro Karma started selling on oct 23 2016 as well as the, GoPro hero 5, and the Hero session 5. A lot of people loved the GoPro karma becasue is is 3 in 1. In the Gopro karma you get the controller, the foldable drone, a hero 5 camera or a hero 4, but the best part it was the
  Gopor Grip. You had a stabilized grip so all they vidoes were like holywood movies. For all that you have with the GoPro karma, for the prize of $799 with out a GoPro camera, with a GoPro Hero 4 or a Heor 5, and a Hero session 5. It was $999 or $1099. that was really cheap for a drone like that, but peopel loved it. but there was something wrong with it just after 3 mothing of the release day. the drone started to
   fall out of the sky becasue the power would just trun off, and the GoPro Kamra did not have a single senser at all. samll deons have senser and they are better then gopro. it also did no have any modes like follow. and that was was the most used mode for peopel. So after all the bad things that were happing with Karma, they recaled all the kamras in 2017. In jan 4, 2017 they relauch it to the public agin, but all 
   the time they were fixing the probles with kamra, DJI had luched 3 NEW DRONES. Like the PHANTOM 4 PRO, PHANTOM 4, and last the new MAVIC PRO. the mavic pro was much better then the GoPro Karma. I was much smaller and wighed less the the karam. the mavic was folduble and could fit in your poukit, you could not do that to the GoPro Kamra you had to us the bag it came with. So after fix all the probles it sill had probles like the gps was not wotking and the Karma would just leave and you would ever see it agin,
  but they fix the problem when it wouuld fall out of the sky. thsi same thing happed the 3DR Solo, they made a drone in 2015, that was the best drone ever. It had follow me and orbit and revil and otehr cool modes. But they had a problem the batter life was bad you only got 20 minutes of fly time, just like the GoPro Karma. the DJI had better life about 25 to 30 minutes of fly time. The 3DR Solo had Gps problems to it
   would take forevery for the controller to pair with the drone, and it sold it gimble 3 monthes after the drone was for sell. So people hated that you had to want 3 months of the gimble.  </p>
